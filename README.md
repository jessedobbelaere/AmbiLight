# KAHO Projecten1: Ambilight voor HTPC

## Description of the project
A backgroundlight system, mounted between the wall and the display. We wrote our own software application to control and monitor the computer display. With the ambilight, it's possible to generate light in real-time that simulates the color palette on the computer display.

## Expectations of the project
The end product will be a backgroundlight for HTPC that will improve and intensify the experience of watching a movie. We expect that the software will control each single ledstrip by using the Arduino microcontroller. One or more colors will be defined in real-time by monitoring the color on the computer display at the moment. With the software application we can bind physical ledstrips to a region on the screen that will be analysed. 

We can choose between Ambilight-mode and ambient lighting (lounge-effect) in the software application. The ambient lighting is a series of light- and transition effects that give a calm and soothing effect while listening to music, relaxing, ...

We can expand the possibilities of the Ambilight by developing a webapplication or remote control iPhone app.
